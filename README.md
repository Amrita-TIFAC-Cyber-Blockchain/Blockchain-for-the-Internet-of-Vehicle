## Abstract
Vehicles are becoming more smarter and autonomous with the rapid growth in Automotive technology and Internet of Things (IoT). Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is gaining popularity, alongside the security challenges associated with them are increasing. To address the security issues and to provide accountability and transparency with privacy to the IoV ecosystem, Blockchain technology would best suite to address the challenges posed. In this thesis, a RealTime Blockchain for Internet of Vehicles is proposed based on BigchainDB and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The entire process from vehicle registration \& its communication with the ecosystem and all the stakeholders are brought on to the blockchain platform. The vehicle log is collected and stored in IPFS and its is monitored by dedicated smart contract services running on the blockchain which takes appropriate actions when conditions are met. The proposed blockchain also has native cryptotokens support that could be used to incentivize good driving behaviours and these tokens could be exchanged at the vehicle service centres, toll booth, fuel refilling stations for payment within the blockchain ecosystem.
